# Reworked source code of CyberVal

Credits go to: all turkish/spanish pasters and to zeroday-z for the complete dead code.

I'm posting my rework from CyberVal because I don't currently have an injector for a current windows version and the project is gathering dust on my computer.

If you have questions, just use the Issues Page.

# Offsets outdated?

I update the offsets here when I have time and feel like it.

Offsets should be updated (04/13/2022) 4.07 - Status: Not tested


# Information
I will not continue the work at this project because i will not inject it anymore in my pc.
If you need help just ask in Issues Page, maybe the community can help you (or if i see it).

Maybe i will update the offsets in future, but for me this project i closed! :)
